previously known as google balls os, my own fedora 43 atomic ublue image!

the iso (with all the apps) is built in https://github.com/weeniemount/weenos-iso

basically this is just a joke meme os and isnt really meant for serious daily use but you can install it wherever idc

cursor_pack_pngs/ isnt built into weenOS, its just a place where i can put the png files of the cursor packs
